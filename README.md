# YOP !

Yop is an ORM tool with a conventional REST webservice Servlet.  
Data objects describe their REST and/or ORM features.  
Data objects are responsible when it is required to add extra behavior (i.e beyond conventional).  
This is **Model-Driven ORM/REST**.

Of course you can use the ORM module without the REST module.
